prophet==1.2.1

# NOTE: This minimal file keeps Prophet (per request) but excludes other heavy
# libraries (tbats, cmdstanpy, pmdarima, catboost). Prophet may still trigger
# long builds depending on the underlying Stan backend — if you prefer a very
# fast initial deploy, remove `prophet` too and reintroduce later.
